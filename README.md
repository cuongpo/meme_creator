- Base network access (mainnet or testnet)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meme_creator.git
   cd meme_creator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and add your configuration:
   - `REACT_APP_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: Get from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/)
   - `REACT_APP_PINATA_JWT`: Get from [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) for IPFS storage

### Running the Backend

The application includes an Express backend for handling meme generation with OpenAI integration:

```bash
# Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env

# Run both frontend and backend concurrently
npm run dev
```

This will start both the React frontend and the Express backend server.
